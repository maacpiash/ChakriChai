# NewsCred

Unlike the rest of the companies mentioned in this repository, NewsCred is not a software development firm. They [identify themselves](www.newscred.com) as an "enterprise content marketing platform".

I applied for the position of SE Intern at the company. I was asked, on 23 September 2018, to attend a code test on the next day at 2 pm. I went to attend the test with my laptop. We (the other contestants and I) were allowed to use wifi to look up any code online. The office was the best looking and most comfortable workspace I had seen at that time. An office staff even offered coffee :relaxed:

At the coding test, I was asked to come up with "a clone of Uber". I had the original specification sheet given by them, but I could not find it (will upload a scanned copy if I find). They basically wanted to see what my idea was on the operation and logistics of a company like Uber, and how I would approach the idea of founding a company.

Naturally, as a coder who loves to see programming tasks in an object-oriented perspective, I immediately came up with class definitions: `Driver`, `Location`; and a `Factory` class with dummy `Location` objects to show off my idea on design patterns. I also implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for calculation of distance, another show off: to display my knowledge on algorithms. Moreover, I came up with how fare should be calculated: a weighted sum of several criteria, such as the capacity of the car, the distance, the driver's ratings and so on. Unfortunately I could not finish all the way to a running program.

After this was over, I was called for the interview in the adjacent room. There were about 6-7 people, all of whom had a friendly, calming look. I was asked to give an introduction and to talk about my then-only publication. I was also asked to explain what I had come up with as the "Uber-clone". Then the questions about this task started coming. Some (not all) of the questions, obviously due to my sheer ignorance and lack of depth of thinking, seemed a bit whimsical to me. Here is an example (paraphrased):

- NewsCred: How would you come up with the route?
- Ahad: I would need geolocation of the points, and a digital sketch of the roads. I think I could use the cellphone's GPS chip for geolocation, and any map service, such as Google Maps API, would be ideal for getting the route.
- N: But what if you could not use Google Maps API?
- A: Then I would use any other map service.
- N: But what if all the map services are unavailable to you?
- A: Well, then I guess I would have to develop a map service by myself.
- N: But could you do the thing without any map service?
- A: Without any map service, I would not know where the roads are, where the buildings etc. are. It would be like a plain white surface. In a scenario like that, the shortest path between two points is the straight line connecting them. But in real world that is not plausible. Anything can disconnect a straight line between two points in a city â€” buildings, parks, lakes and so on.

I immediately realized that the answer I was giving was not what the interview board wanted to hear. The interview was short, about 20 minutes.

I was rejected for the post on 8 October 2018 via an email.
