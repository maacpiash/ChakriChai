[Cefalo](https://www.cefalo.com/) is, according to their website, "a Norway based consulting and offshoring company." They have a branch office in Bangladesh, at Dhanmondi, Dhaka.

I originally applied for the post of C#/ASP.NET DEVELOPER (R&D) on 17 September 2018. Since I was not experienced enough, I was offered instead a junior ASP.NET developer post, with a 6-month probationary period. I was given this assignment on 21 September 2018, after a conversation with a high-ranked person working there on the night before. I had seven days to complete this, but I completed it on 2 October 2018.

I attended a technical interview on 11 October 2018. It lasted about 2 hours and 30 minutes. I was asked questions on the assignment, C# language, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQL, design patterns, OOP concepts, and many more topics. I even got my English language skills tested.

I was rejected for the post on 23 November 2018, exactly at midnight.
