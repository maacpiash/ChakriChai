# Enosis

According to their website, [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/) is "an offshore software engineering, image processing and consultancy company...". Their office is situated at Gulshan-1, Dhaka.

Enosis got the names-and-descriptions of my friends and I during our capstone project showcase (fall 2017) at NSU campus. I was considered for the position of Software Engineer. I got called (via email) on 20 February 2018, for the written test on 22 February 2018. It was a test on "Analytical ability", "Basic programming" and "Software testing". I attended the test and did pretty well, to my knowledge.

After that test, I got called (again, via email) on 27 February 2018 to attend a coding test on 28 February 2018. I attended the test. I was given two problems. I only managed to solve problem 1. Problem 2 was a postfix expression evaluation problem.

After the test, I never received an email or a phone call from them, regarding this matter. I emailed them on 8 March 2018. I never got a reply on this.
