<h2 align="center">All my rejections live here.</h1>

This repository is a collection of coding tests and assignments that I have attended or completed over the span of 2018.

My intention is not to bad-mouth any software company mentioned here. I'm sure I did not get employed only because I was not worthy of the position(s).

I would be very happy if this repository helps anyone with prospects of getting hired at a software company in Bangladesh.
